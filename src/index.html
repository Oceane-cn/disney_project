                A young circus elephant is born with comically large ears and
                given the cruel nickname Dumbo. One day at a show, he is taunted
                by a group of kids, inciting his mother into a rage that gets
                her locked up. After Dumbo's ears cause an accident that injures
                many of the other elephants, he is made to dress like a clown
                and perform dangerous stunts. Everything changes when Dumbo
                discovers that his enormous ears actually allow him to fly, and
                he astounds everyone at the circus with his new talent.

                Geppetto is a lonely woodcarver who makes a boy puppet and
                wishes, with all his might, that the puppet was alive. As
                Geppetto sleeps, Pinocchio is given life by the Blue Fairy.
                There's a catch, though. Pinocchio is alive, but he won't be a
                real boy until he proves himself and to help him, Jiminy Cricket
                is designated his Official Conscience. In the morning, Geppetto
                is thrilled to see that his puppet is alive and does what any
                father would do. He sends Pinocchio off to school - and into
                trouble. Pinocchio must learn to be honest, and brave, before he
                is allowed to become a real boy. Will he learn in time?

                dwarfs—Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Happy, Bashful, Sleepy and Dopey.
                But when the Queen tricks Snow White with an enchanted apple,
                only the magic of true love's kiss can save her!
